\begin{itemize}
  \item This paper revisits the use of Correspondence Analysis (CA) in analyzing two-mode network data, highlighting its potential beyond data visualization.
  \item CA can compute a dual centrality score on both modes of a two-mode network, related to but not mathematically equivalent to the Bonacich (1991) two-mode centrality. 
  \item CA can extract latent positional information on people and groups, with similarities to recent work on generalized relational similarity" in two-mode networks.
